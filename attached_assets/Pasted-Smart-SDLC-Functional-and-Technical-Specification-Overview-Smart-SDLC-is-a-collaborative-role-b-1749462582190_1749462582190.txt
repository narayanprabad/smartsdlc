Smart SDLC - Functional and Technical Specification

Overview:
Smart SDLC is a collaborative, role-based, agentic, AI-assisted web platform that automates and streamlines the software development lifecycle. It enables multiple personas to interact through intelligent prompts, document ingestion, and progressive workflows—from requirements gathering to user acceptance testing.

The UI is built with native JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS, requiring no NPM installation. The backend is implemented using Node.js (native modules only), designed to avoid CORS by handling document fetching server-side.

1. User Management & Multi-Tenancy

Login/Registration:

Role-based login (Business Analyst, Architect, Developer, etc.)

Multi-profile support (e.g., Global Clearing BA, PFT BA, etc.)

Secure authentication (support for future SSO integration)

Groups & Roles:

Each profile maps to one or more user groups (e.g., Global Clearing BA → Global Clearing Architect Group)

Admin interface for creating user profiles and assigning them to groups

Every profile includes a provision to assign the individual or group to the next phase in the SDLC (e.g., Business Analyst → Architect, Architect → Developer)

Project Managers have a dedicated interface to assign tasks and artifacts to any role, including Infra/DevOps developers, QA, and UAT teams

2. Business Analyst Module

Landing Page: Tailored welcome message based on the profile (e.g., “Welcome, Global Clearing BA”)

Key Features:

Prompt-driven agent interface to:

Drag and drop multiple files: PDF, Word, Excel, PPT, ZIP

Support for images (JPG, PNG, TIFF)

Authentication-based access with fallback to browser prompt for login

Output: Auto-generated use cases with:

Title, Description, Actors, Dependencies

Metadata (Source File, Timestamp)

Sequence Diagrams

Component Diagrams

Deployment Views

Editable canvas with export to PDF

Iterative refinement of architecture

Version tracking and approval system

Assign refined architectures or design elements to UI developers, backend developers, or DevOps teams

4. UI/UX Developer Module

Key Features:

View use cases with assigned workflows

AI-generated wireframes for each use case

Exportable HTML skeletons

Real-time visual editor to:

Create responsive mockups

Dashboard for sprint planning and burn-down chart

Workflow:

Align Use Case → User Story → Sprint

Send for Business Analyst sign-off

Log in approvals, rejections, comments

Assign any deliverable to the next role in the chain, including:

Infra/DevOps engineers

QA/UAT testers

End-users for review

6. Developer Module

Key Features:

View sprint-aligned stories

Auto-linked to Jira (optional future integration)

Agent assistant for code scaffolding suggestions

Developer notepad with AI to:

Summarize assigned tasks

Help generate boilerplate code (native JS, Java, etc.)

7. DevOps / Infrastructure Module

Key Features:

Auto-suggested deployment diagrams based on architecture

Instructions for setting up CI/CD pipelines

Dashboard for infrastructure health (placeholder for integrations)

Provision for environment configurations

Tasks assigned by Project Managers or Architects directly

8. User Acceptance Tester (UAT)

Key Features:

View completed features linked to original use cases

Submit test scenarios

Track status of test cases: Passed, Failed, Blocked

Raise bugs linked to Developer module

Receive test instructions assigned by Project Managers

9. End Users / Stakeholders

Key Features:

Simple portal to:

Raise issues/bugs linked to features

View resolution status

Participate in feedback surveys

10. Cross-Cutting Features

Audit Trail: Every action (upload, assign, approve, reject) logged with user, timestamp

Versioning: Use cases, architecture, UI designs are versioned

Exports: Each role can export reports, requirements, designs in PDF/HTML

Notifications: Event-based notifications for assignments, signoffs, and feedback

11. Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

Backend: Node.js with Express (no NPM dependency, use only native modules)

Storage: Local file-based JSON storage (extensible to DB in future)

Authentication: Basic auth (JWT/SSO in roadmap)

Document Parsing:

OCR: Use Tesseract.js (can be hosted)

PDF: Native PDF.js or server-side PDF parsing

Excel: JS-based XLSX reader

Server-side File Handling:

All URL and file processing done in backend to avoid CORS

Previews and summaries generated using server logic

12. Future Enhancements

Integration with Jira, Confluence, GitHub

Enhanced LLM-based context-aware agents

Real-time collaboration (WebSocket-based)

Mobile-optimized experience

Plug-in-based extension system for workflows

Summary:
Smart SDLC is a plug-and-play, intelligent SDLC automation tool that empowers each stakeholder in the software lifecycle. With drag-and-drop document handling, role-based agentic behavior, and no external dependencies, it's optimized for enterprise use and rapid deployment.
