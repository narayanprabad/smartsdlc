“Imagine it is 2028.

J.P. Morgan is running thousands of production systems across regions, regulators, and asset classes.
AI is generating code.
Engineers are shipping faster than ever.
Regulatory scrutiny is tighter than ever.

A regulator asks a simple question:

‘Why does this logic exist in your trading platform?’

Today

We open Confluence.
We search JIRA.
We check Git history.
We scan test reports.
We assemble SMEs.
We create a war room.
We reconstruct the past.

It works.
But it’s manual.
Fragmented.
And dependent on people remembering context.

2028

No war room.
No email threads.
No manual trace across tools.

You press a button.

In seconds, the system shows:

The original business intent.
The architecture decision.
The stories created.
The commits merged.
The tests executed.
The deployment history.
The runtime behavior.

End-to-end.
Verifiable.
Auditable.

That is not science fiction.

That is coherence.

And that is what Smart SDLC is building.”**
