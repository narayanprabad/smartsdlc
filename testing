“In Jurassic Park, there was technology everywhere — sensors, fences, trackers.
But the system didn’t understand why things were happening.
It could report events, but not the meaning behind them.”

“In many ways, our delivery environments are similar.”

“Our tooling is strong.
Jira shows activity.
Git shows change.
CI shows pass or fail.
Observability shows incidents.”

“But each system tells only part of the story.”

“What’s often missing is the connection —
why a change was made,
what decision it implemented,
and when it was truly ready.”

“That’s not a tooling problem.
It’s a systems limitation.”
