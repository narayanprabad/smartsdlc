Fix Option A (Fastest): Relax cookie characters (Spring Boot)

Add this to application.properties (or your cloud config):

server.tomcat.relaxed-cookie-chars=|,{,},[,],\,^,`,",<,>,;
server.tomcat.relaxed-path-chars=|,{,},[,],\,^,`,",<,>,;

Start with this minimal set if you want safer:

server.tomcat.relaxed-cookie-chars=[,],|,{},\

Then redeploy and check logs: the “invalid cookie” warnings should disappear.

Fix Option B (Tomcat-side): Legacy cookie processor

If you can edit Tomcat config in that cloud image:

In context.xml (global or app context):

<Context>
  <CookieProcessor className="org.apache.tomcat.util.http.LegacyCookieProcessor"/>
</Context>

Restart Tomcat.

This makes Tomcat more forgiving and is often the standard fix for older SSO cookies.

Fix Option C: Fix it at the source (IAM / SiteMinder team)

Best long-term: ask IAM to ensure the cookie conforms to RFC6265:

Avoid special characters in cookie value (or properly encode)

Ensure correct SameSite / Secure flags

But in enterprise reality, A or B is what people do.
