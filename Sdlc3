Subject: Reflections and Learnings from Smart Invest ‚Äì An AI Exploration in Financial Services

Dear Team,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some learnings and experiences from a recent internal project, Smart Invest, developed in collaboration with two fellow technologists from the wider Markets area. This effort was part of our ongoing exploration into how AI and machine learning can enhance client experiences in financial services.

About the Project

Smart Invest is a lightweight prototype that uses machine learning and conversational AI to offer personalized investment guidance. The aim was not to build a complete product, but rather to test ideas and learn by doing ‚Äî and in the process, better understand how emerging technologies can be meaningfully applied in our domain.

Key Takeaways

üîç Practical Applications of AI/ML

Used XGBoost for basic portfolio recommendations, which helped us appreciate how ensemble models can enhance accuracy in financial contexts.

Explored ARIMA time series forecasting to model simple market trends.

Integrated conversational NLP with the help of AWS Bedrock and a pre-trained BERT model, allowing the assistant to interpret user intent and provide relevant responses.


üõ†Ô∏è Full Stack Development with Agent Support

While none of us are UI specialists, we were able to use AI agents and tools like GitHub Copilot to build functional frontends using React and TypeScript, backed by a Node.js service.

Managed live data processing and multi-currency financial datasets using PostgreSQL and real-time APIs.


üåê Broader Perspectives Gained

Learned how to navigate regulatory considerations when building financial applications across multiple markets.

Gained firsthand experience applying AI in a business-relevant setting ‚Äî while ensuring it remains interpretable and usable for end users.

Practiced explaining ML-driven insights in a way that non-technical stakeholders could easily understand.


Thank You

A heartfelt thanks to Sean and Jregar for attending our demo and for the encouragement ‚Äî it meant a lot to our small team.

While it‚Äôs still early days for this idea, we found the process insightful and energizing. We‚Äôd be glad to share our learnings in more detail, or explore if any of these approaches might support initiatives across our broader team.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
