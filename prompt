Create a high-resolution software architecture diagram (1920x1080 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio) suitable for PowerPoint presentation showing a unified end-to-end exercise, assignment, and stock trade processing flow. Use landscape orientation with clear visual hierarchy and legible fonts (minimum 12pt). Ensure proper spacing between components for readability when projected. Unified Flow Architecture: Entry Point (Far Left): Show CCP Files from Exchanges as the single source. These files contain both Exercise/Assignment files AND Stock Trade files. Gemm System (Left-Center, Large Container): All CCP files flow into Gemm which contains: * GFP Screen / Deliveries Admin UI for file configuration onboarding * Unified Processing Pipeline (horizontal): Extractor → Enricher → Appender → Producer (transforms both file types to standardized format) * Maker-Checker Workflow (approval gateway) * File Tracker with Kafka Publisher (publishes notifications for both file types) Kafka Event Bus (Center): Show message broker connecting Gemm to Encore, carrying notifications for both exercise/assignment files and stock trade files. Encore System (Right-Center, Large Container): Encore receives Kafka notifications and contains two parallel processing engines: 1. Position Balancing Engine Path (Upper flow): * File Metadata Retrieval * Open Interest Calculation * Position Balancing Engine (with YAML Config) * Outputs: Exercise/Assignment Instructions 2. Stock Trade Balancing Engine Path (Lower flow): * Consumes Stock Trade files from same Kafka stream * Stock Trade Balancing Engine * Performs reconciliation Downstream Flow (Right Side): From Position Balancing Engine, Exercise/Assignment Instructions flow to: * GMI/Nessie via Trade Cube Booking Adapter * Client Experience Platform (instant notifications) Connected Cycle Flow: Show that Exercise/Assignment Instructions booked in GMI/Nessie trigger Treasury/IGS Systems to generate Stock Trades. These Stock Trades flow back to Nessie AND also return to CCP (creating a feedback loop shown with curved arrow back to top). Stock Trades are also sent as RVP/DVP Settlement Instructions to AME and Clearing House. The Stock Trades from Nessie feed back into Encore's Stock Trade Balancing Engine (show this as a connecting arrow from Nessie back to Encore's lower processing path). The Stock Trade Balancing Engine reconciles Nessie output with Exchange Stock Trade feed, identifies breaks, and sends to Operations Team for corrective actions. Layout Guidance: * Arrange as a continuous left-to-right flow with feedback loops * Use a single horizontal swim-lane approach rather than separate phases * Show the circular dependency: CCP Files → Gemm → Encore Position Balancing → GMI/Nessie → Treasury/IGS → Stock Trades → Back to Nessie → Encore Stock Trade Balancing * Use curved arrows to show feedback loops clearly * Position components to emphasize the continuous, cyclical nature Styling Requirements: * Use professional color palette: blues for Gemm components, greens for Encore components, purples for Treasury/IGS, oranges for external systems * Thicker arrows for primary data flows, thinner arrows for feedback loops * Clear directional arrows with labels * Group Gemm and Encore components with subtle background containers * Use icons for: Kafka (message), databases (cylinder), workflows (diamond), external systems (cloud) * Add small numbered sequence indicators (1, 2, 3...) to show flow order * Ensure all text is sans-serif, bold for system names * Use solid lines for forward flows, dashed lines for feedback loops * Maintain consistent spacing (minimum 50px between major components) * Add a small legend explaining the flow sequence Generate a clean, professional diagram that clearly shows this is ONE integrated end-to-end process, not separate workflows, suitable for executive presentation with maximum clarity.
